# Using the Bulk Whois API web service

[Bulk Whois API](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/bulk-whois-api.php) provides
[Whois](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/whois-api-doc.php) records for a
list of Domains/IPs via a single REST API query.

Here you'll find examples of using the API implemented in multiple languages.

You'll need a [WhoisXmlApi account](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/user/create.php)
to authenticate.
