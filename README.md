# Using the Bulk Whois API web service

[Bulk Whois API](https://whois.whoisxmlapi.com/bulk-api) provides
[Whois](https://whois.whoisxmlapi.com/documentation/making-requests) records for a
list of Domains/IPs via a single REST API query.

Here you'll find examples of querying the API implemented in multiple
languages.

You'll need a
[WhoisXmlApi account](https://whois.whoisxmlapi.com/api/signup)
to authenticate.

Please, refer to the
[Bulk Whois API User Guide](https://whois.whoisxmlapi.com/bulk-api/documentation/making-requests)
for info on input parameters, request/response formats, authentication
instructions and more.
